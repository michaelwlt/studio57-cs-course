# OSSU CS Simplified

A modern, user-friendly interface for the [Open Source Society University (OSSU) Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). This project aims to make the OSSU curriculum more accessible, organized, and easier to navigate.

## What is OSSU?

The OSSU curriculum is a complete, free education in computer science using online materials. It's designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education requirements.

## Features

- **Well-structured curriculum**: Organized into logical sections (Intro CS, Core CS, Advanced CS, Final Project)
- **Clear learning paths**: Each section includes course sequences, prerequisites, and learning outcomes
- **Modern interface**: Built with Hugo and the Hextra theme for a clean, responsive design
- **Comprehensive content**: Covers everything from programming basics to advanced specializations

This project is built using:
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - Static site generator
