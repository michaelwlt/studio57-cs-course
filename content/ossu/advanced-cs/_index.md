# Advanced Computer Science

The Advanced CS section corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum. After completing all required courses in Core CS, you should choose a subset of courses from Advanced CS based on your interests and career goals.

## Specialization Areas

Advanced CS is divided into several specialization areas:

1. [Advanced Programming](/ossu/advanced-cs/programming/) - Explore advanced programming concepts and paradigms
2. [Advanced Systems](/ossu/advanced-cs/systems/) - Delve deeper into computer architecture and systems design
3. [Advanced Theory](/ossu/advanced-cs/theory/) - Study advanced theoretical computer science
4. [Advanced Information Security](/ossu/advanced-cs/security/) - Specialize in cybersecurity and information assurance 
5. [Advanced Math](/ossu/advanced-cs/math/) - Develop deeper mathematical foundations for specialized work

## How to Choose

You don't need to take every course from Advanced CS. Instead:

- Choose specializations that align with your interests and career goals
- Take every course that is relevant to your chosen specialization
- Consider interdisciplinary connections between specializations
- Use these courses to build depth in areas you're passionate about

## Prerequisites

Before beginning Advanced CS, you should have:

- Completed **every required course** in [Core CS](/ossu/core-cs/)
- Strong programming skills in at least one language
- Solid understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Familiarity with computer systems concepts
- Mathematical foundations from Core Math

## Learning Outcomes

The Advanced CS courses will help you:

1. Develop specialized knowledge in your chosen areas
2. Build a competitive advantage for industry or academic positions
3. Explore cutting-edge concepts and technologies
4. Prepare for graduate-level study if desired
5. Connect theoretical knowledge with practical applications
6. Develop the expertise needed for specialized roles
