3. **Haskell** introduces pure functional programming, changing how you think about code
4. **Prolog** demonstrates declarative logic programming, perfect for certain problem domains
5. **Software Debugging** provides systematic approaches to finding and fixing bugs
6. **Software Testing** teaches methodical verification of software correctness

## Learning Outcomes

After studying Advanced Programming, you will be able to:

1. Write concurrent and parallel code that efficiently uses modern hardware
2. Understand how programming languages are parsed, compiled, and executed
3. Apply functional programming concepts to write more maintainable code
4. Use logic programming for appropriate problem domains
5. Debug software systematically and efficiently
6. Implement effective testing strategies for ensuring software quality
7. Choose the right programming paradigm for different problems

## Career Relevance

These advanced programming skills are particularly valuable for:
