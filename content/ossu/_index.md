Welcome to the Open Source Society University (OSSU) Computer Science curriculum. This is a comprehensive path to a free, self-taught education in computer science.

## About OSSU

The OSSU curriculum provides a complete education in computer science using online materials that are freely available. It's designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education requirements.

The courses included are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, and other top institutions. They have been specifically chosen to meet high standards in teaching quality and content coverage.

## Curriculum Structure

The curriculum is divided into several sections:

1. **Prerequisites** - Foundational knowledge required before starting
2. **Intro CS** - Introduction to Computer Science
3. **Core CS** - Equivalent to the first three years of a CS degree
   - Core Programming
   - Core Math
   - CS Tools
   - Core Systems
   - Core Theory
   - Core Security
   - Core Applications
   - Core Ethics
4. **Advanced CS** - Equivalent to final year specializations
   - Advanced Programming
   - Advanced Systems
   - Advanced Theory
   - Advanced Information Security
   - Advanced Math
5. **Final Project** - Apply your knowledge to solve real-world problems

Explore each section to find detailed course listings, resources, and progression paths.

## Getting Started

If you're new to computer science, start with the [Intro CS](/ossu/intro-cs/) section. It will give you a flavor of what's to come and help you determine if computer science is right for you.

If you already have some experience, you might want to jump directly to [Core CS](/ossu/core-cs/) and begin with the specific areas you're interested in.

## Duration and Cost

- **Duration**: It's possible to complete the curriculum in about 2 years with 20 hours/week of study
- **Cost**: All or nearly all course material is available for free

Remember, you can't purchase success! The key is dedication and consistent effort.
