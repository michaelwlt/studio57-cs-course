# Core Ethics

This section addresses the ethical dimensions of computer science and technology. As computing systems increasingly influence society, understanding the ethical implications of technology is essential for responsible innovation.

## Topics Covered

- Social Context of Technology
- Analytical Tools for Ethical Analysis
- Professional Ethics
- Intellectual Property
- Privacy and Civil Liberties
- Data Ethics
- Algorithmic Bias
- Technology Regulations
- And more

## Course Sequence

| Course | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Ethics, Technology and Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ethics-technology-engineering) | 9 weeks | 2 hours/week | None |
| [Introduction to Intellectual Property](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-intellectual-property) | 4 weeks | 2 hours/week | None |
| [Data Privacy Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/northeastern-data-privacy) | 3 weeks | 3 hours/week | None |

## Why These Courses?

This sequence introduces key ethical frameworks and considerations for technology:

1. **Ethics, Technology and Engineering** provides a foundational understanding of ethical principles in engineering and technology
2. **Introduction to Intellectual Property** explains how ideas and creations are protected legally
3. **Data Privacy Fundamentals** addresses the increasingly important domain of privacy in a data-driven world

## Learning Outcomes

After completing the Core Ethics sequence, you will be able to:

1. Identify ethical issues in technology development and deployment
2. Apply ethical frameworks to analyze technology-related problems
3. Understand intellectual property concepts and their application to software
4. Recognize privacy concerns in data collection and processing
5. Make more ethically informed decisions about technology design
6. Consider the societal impacts of technological innovation

## Importance for Computer Science

Ethical understanding is critical in computer science because:

- Technologies can have unintended consequences for society
- Design decisions embed values and biases
- Privacy and security trade-offs require ethical judgment
- Different stakeholders may have competing interests
- Legal and regulatory frameworks increasingly address ethical concerns
- Professional codes of ethics guide responsible practice

As a computer scientist, the systems you build will affect people's lives. This section helps you develop the ethical reasoning skills needed to build technology that benefits humanity while minimizing harm.
