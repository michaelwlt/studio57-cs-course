- Network protocols
- And more

## Course Sequence

| Course | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) | 6 weeks | 7-13 hours/week | C-like programming language |
| [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) | 6 weeks | 12-18 hours/week | Nand to Tetris Part I |
| [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) | 10-12 weeks | 6-10 hours/week | Nand to Tetris Part II |

## Why These Courses?

This sequence provides a comprehensive bottom-up understanding of computer systems:

1. **Nand to Tetris** teaches you how to build a computer from fundamental logic gates
2. **Nand to Tetris Part II** continues by implementing a compiler and an operating system
3. **Operating Systems** dives deeper into OS concepts, including virtualization, concurrency, and persistence
4. **Computer Networking** explains how computers communicate through network protocols

## Learning Outcomes

After completing the Core Systems sequence, you will understand:

1. How computers are built from the transistor level up
2. How hardware and software interact
3. How operating systems manage resources and provide abstractions
4. How computer networks enable communication between systems
5. How compilers translate high-level code to machine code

## Importance for Computer Science

Systems knowledge is critical because:

- It removes the mystery of how computers work
- It helps you write more efficient code
- It enables you to debug complex problems
- It provides insight into performance issues
- It forms the foundation for many specialized fields (embedded systems, cybersecurity, etc.)

Whether you plan to work at a high level of abstraction or close to the hardware, understanding the full stack of computing will make you a more effective computer scientist.
