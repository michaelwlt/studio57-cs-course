The Core CS section corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, covering classes that all CS majors would be required to take.

All coursework under Core CS is **required** to complete the OSSU Computer Science curriculum, unless otherwise indicated.

## Core CS Subject Areas

The Core CS curriculum is divided into several subject areas, each focusing on a critical aspect of computer science:

1. [Core Programming](/ossu/core-cs/programming/) - Learn programming fundamentals and paradigms
2. [Core Math](/ossu/core-cs/math/) - Build mathematical foundations for computer science
3. [CS Tools](/ossu/core-cs/tools/) - Master essential development tools
4. [Core Systems](/ossu/core-cs/systems/) - Understand computer architecture and systems
5. [Core Theory](/ossu/core-cs/theory/) - Study algorithms and theoretical computer science
6. [Core Security](/ossu/core-cs/security/) - Learn principles of secure software and systems
7. [Core Applications](/ossu/core-cs/applications/) - Apply CS concepts to real-world domains
8. [Core Ethics](/ossu/core-cs/ethics/) - Explore ethical considerations in technology

## Learning Path

We recommend working through the Core CS curriculum in the order presented above, though some subjects can be studied concurrently. For example:

- Math courses can be taken in parallel with programming courses
- CS Tools can be learned while working through other subjects
- Advanced subjects should only be attempted after completing their prerequisites

## Prerequisites

Before beginning Core CS, you should have:

- Completed [Intro CS](/ossu/intro-cs/) or have equivalent programming experience
- Knowledge of high school mathematics, including algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus
- A willingness to dedicate significant time to study and practice
