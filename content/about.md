The [Open Source Society University (OSSU)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) offers a complete, free education in computer science using online materials. We've integrated this curriculum into our site to make it more accessible.

## What is OSSU?

OSSU provides a comprehensive education in computer science using freely available online materials. The curriculum is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education requirements.

The courses are selected from some of the world's best institutions, including Harvard, Princeton, and MIT, and meet high standards for quality in teaching materials and content coverage.

## Curriculum Overview

The OSSU Computer Science curriculum is structured as follows:

1. [**Prerequisites**](/ossu/#prerequisites) - Foundation knowledge required before starting
   
2. [**Intro CS**](/ossu/intro-cs/) - Introduction to Computer Science
   - Introduction to programming and CS basics
   - Python programming
   
3. [**Core CS**](/ossu/core-cs/) - Required foundation courses (first 3 years)
   - [Core Programming](/ossu/core-cs/programming/) - Programming fundamentals, paradigms, and practices
   - [Core Math](/ossu/core-cs/math/) - Mathematical foundations for computer science
   - [CS Tools](/ossu/core-cs/tools/) - Essential development tools
   - [Core Systems](/ossu/core-cs/systems/) - Computer architecture and systems
   - [Core Theory](/ossu/core-cs/theory/) - Algorithms and theoretical CS
   - [Core Security](/ossu/core-cs/security/) - Computer security basics
   - [Core Applications](/ossu/core-cs/applications/) - Applied areas like databases and ML
   - [Core Ethics](/ossu/core-cs/ethics/) - Ethics in computing
   
4. [**Advanced CS**](/ossu/advanced-cs/) - Elective specializations (final year)
   - [Advanced Programming](/ossu/advanced-cs/programming/) - Advanced programming concepts
   - Advanced Systems - Computer architecture and systems design
   - Advanced Theory - Theoretical computer science
   - Advanced Information Security - Cybersecurity specialization
   - Advanced Math - Mathematical foundations for specialized areas
   
5. [**Final Project**](/ossu/final-project/) - Capstone project to demonstrate skills

## Benefits of Following This Curriculum

- **High-Quality Education**: Access to university-level courses from top institutions
- **Comprehensive**: Covers the full range of computer science topics
- **Free**: All materials are freely available online
- **Self-Paced**: Learn at your own speed and on your own schedule
- **Project-Based**: Apply knowledge through practical projects
- **Community Support**: Join a worldwide community of learners

## Getting Started

If you're new to computer science, we recommend starting with the [Intro CS](/ossu/intro-cs/) section. This will introduce you to programming and give you a taste of what computer science is about.

If you already have some programming experience, you might want to directly explore the [Core CS](/ossu/core-cs/) sections that interest you most.

## Time Commitment

It's possible to complete the entire curriculum in about 2 years with approximately 20 hours of study per week. However, the self-paced nature of the program means you can adjust the timeline to fit your schedule and learning speed.
